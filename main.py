        You will need to generate a cover letter based on specific resume and a job description.
        My resume text: {res_text}
        The job description is: {job_desc}
        The candidate's name to include on the cover letter: {user_name}
        The job title/role: {role}
        The hiring manager is: {manager}
        How you heard about the opportunity: {referral}
        The company to which you are generating the cover letter for: {company}
        The cover letter should have three content paragraphs.
        In the first paragraph, focus on who you are, what position you are interested in, where you heard about it, and summarize what you have to offer.
        In the second paragraph, focus on why the candidate is a great fit, drawing parallels between the resume experience and the job description qualifications.
        In the third paragraph, restate your interest in the organization and/or job, summarize what you have to offer, and thank the reader.
        Use {user_name} as the candidate.
        Generate a specific cover letter based on the above.
